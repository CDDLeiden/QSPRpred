class BenchmarkRunner:
    """Class that runs benchmarking experiments as defined by
    `BenchmarkSettings`. It translates the settings into
    a list of `Replica` objects with its `iterReplicas` method and
    runs them in parallel. Each replica is processed by the `runReplica`
    method.

    The report from each replica is appended to a `resultsFile`, which
    is read and returned by the `run` method after the runners is finished
    with all replicas. All outputs generated by the replicas and the `BenchmarkSettings`
    used are saved in the `dataDir`.

    The random seed for each replica is determined in a pseudo-random way from
     `BenchmarkSettings.random_seed`. The `getSeedList` method is used to generate
     a list of seeds from this 'master' seed. There are some caveats to this method
     (see the docstring of `getSeedList`).
