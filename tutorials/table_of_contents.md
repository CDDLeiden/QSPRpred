## Table of Contents

This is a list of tutorials for QSPRpred. A Quick Start tutorial is designed to get you up and running with QSPRpred as quickly as possible. 
The rest of the the tutorials is diveded into two categories: basic and advanced. 
The Basics tutorials cover all basic functionality of QSPRpred that you will need in most projects. The Advanced tutorials cover more advanced topics and are designed for users who are already familiar with the basics of QSPRpred.
For detailed description of all QSPRpred classes and functions, see the [documentation](https://cddleiden.github.io/QSPRpred/docs/).
